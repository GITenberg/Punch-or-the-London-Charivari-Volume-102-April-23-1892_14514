    <h2>TOWN THOUGHTS FROM THE COUNTRY.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>With the usual apologies.</i>)</h4>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Oh, to be in London now that April's there,</p>

            <p>And whoever walks in London sees, some morning, in
            the Square,</p>

            <p>That the upper thousands have come to Town,</p>

            <p>To the plane-trees droll in their new bark gown,</p>

            <p>While the sparrows chirp, and the cats miaow</p>

            <p>In London&mdash;now!</p>

            <p>And after April, when May follows</p>

            <p>And the black-coats come and go like swallows!</p>

            <p>Mark, where yon fairy blossom in the Row</p>

            <p>Leans to the rails, and canters on in clover,</p>

            <p>Blushing and drooping, with her head bent low!</p>

            <p>That's the wise child: she makes him ask twice
            over,</p>

            <p>Lest he should think she views with too much
            rapture</p>

            <p>Her first fine wealthy capture!</p>

            <p>But,&mdash;though her path looks smooth, and though,
            alack,</p>

            <p>All will he gay, till Time has painted black</p>

            <p>The <i>Marigold</i>, her Mother's chosen
            flower,&mdash;</p>

            <p>Far brighter is my <i>Heartsease</i>, Love's own
            dower.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <hr />

    <p>A WANT.&mdash;"There is only one thing," a visitor writes to
    us, "that I missed at Venice, S.W. I've never been to the real
    place, which is the Bride, or Pride, of the Sea, I forget
    which, but, as I was saying, there's only one thing I miss, and
    that is the heather. Who has not heard of 'the moor of Venice'?
    And I daresay good shooting there too, with black game and such
    like. I only saw pigeons flying, who some one informed me are
    the pigeons of SAM MARK. Next time I go, I shall inquire at the
    Restaurant for fresh Pigeon Pie. However, if Mr. KIRALFY will
    take a hint, he will, in August provide a moor. It will add to
    the gaiety of the show. 'The moor the merrier,' eh?"</p>
    <hr />

    <h3>Neo-Dramatic Nursery Rhyme.</h3>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>MRS. GRUNDY, good woman, scarce knew what to
            think</p>

            <p>About the relation 'twixt Drama and Drink.</p>

            <p>Well, give Hall&mdash;and Theatre&mdash;good
            wholesome diet,</p>

            <p>And all who attend will be sober and quiet!</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <hr />

    <p>SPRING'S DELIGHTS IN LONDON.&mdash;"VIA
    MALODORA"&mdash;clearly a lady, "DORA" for short&mdash;wrote to
    the <i>Times</i> complaining that the result of the splendid
    weather for the first ten days of the month was the
    reproduction of "summer effluvium rank and offensive" in
    Piccadilly. Poor Piccadilly! Oh, its "offence is rank," and
    Miss DORA might add, quoting to her father from another scene
    in <i>Hamlet</i>, "And smells so. Pa'!" West-Enders, in a dry
    summer, must he prepared to have "a high old time of it."</p>

        OF WORSHIP CONSECRATED?"</p>

        <p><i>Domestic</i> (<i>lately received into the Plymouth

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>I'm the maker of a Soap, which I confidently
            hope</p>

            <p>In the advertising tournament will win,</p>

            <p>And remain the fit survival, having vanquished every
            rival</p>

            <p>Which is very detrimental to the skin.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>I will now proceed to show, what the public ought to
            know,</p>

            <p>Unless they would be blindly taken in.</p>

            <p>How in every soap but mine certain qualities
            combine</p>

            <p>To make it detrimental to the skin.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>But surely at this date it is needless I should
            state</p>

            <p>That the cheaper soaps are barely worth a pin,</p>

            <p>For they all contain a mixture, either free or as a
            fixture,</p>

            <p>Which is very detrimental to the skin.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>And every cake you buy is so charged with
            alkali,</p>

            <p>To soda more than soap it is akin;</p>

            <p>It is really dear at last, for it wastes away so
            fast.</p>

            <p>And is very detrimental to the skin.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>The public I must warn of the colours that adorn</p>

            <p>The soaps ambitious foreigners bring in;</p>

            <p>They are often very pretty, but to use them is a
            pity,</p>

            <p>For they're very detrimental to the skin.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>There are soaps which you can see through. I ask,
            What can it be through?</p>

            <p>Is it resin, or some other form of sin?</p>

            <p>There are soaps which smell too strong, and of
            course that must be wrong,</p>

            <p>And extremely detrimental to the skin.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>And too much fat's injurious, and so are soaps
            sulphureous,</p>

            <p>Though they say they keep the hair from growing
            thin;</p>

            <p>They may keep a person's hair on, like the precious
            oil of AARON,</p>

            <p>And yet be detrimental to his skin.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>In short, the only soap which is fit for Prince or
            Pope</p>

            <p>(I have sent some to the KAISER at Berlin)</p>

            <p>Is the article I sell you. Don't believe the firms
            who tell you</p>

            <p>It is very detrimental to the skin.</p>
        </div>

    <p>A LIQUOR QUESTION.&mdash;Why does a toper&mdash;especially
    when "before the beak"&mdash;always say that he was "in drink,"
    when he evidently means that the drink was in him? The only
    soaker on record who could rightly be said to be "in drink"
    was,</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Maudlin <i>Clarence</i> in his Malmsey butt."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>He was "in liquor" with a vengeance. But less lucky
    wine-bibbers need not be illogical as well as inebriate.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>MR. GOSCHEN'S BUDGET.&mdash;"From a fiscal point of view,
    the Tobacco receipts are extremely good." So unlike JOKIM. Of
    course, as he never loses a chance of a <i>jeu de mot</i>, what
    he must have said was, that "the Tobacco 'returns' are
    extremely good." "A birthday Budget,&mdash;many happy
    'returns,'" he observed jocosely to PRINCE ARTHUR, "quite
    japing times!" And off he went for his holiday; and, weather
    permitting, as he reclines in his funny among the weeds, he
    will gently murmur, "<i>Dulce est desipere in smoko</i>."</p>

    <p>FETTERED.&mdash;In reply to the Unemployed Deputation which
    found employment in paying a visit to the L.C.C. at Spring
    Gardens, Messrs. BURNS and BEN TILLETT (Alderman) intimated
    that as Mr. POWER, the U.D.'s spokesman, was not a member of
    the L.C.C., that body was Power-less to assist them in their
    trouble. A nasty time of it had the Labour Candidates on this
    occasion. Nothing like putting men of Radical revolutionary
    tendencies into responsible positions.</p>

    <p>A SHADY VALET.&mdash;One DONALD CROSS was a Valet in the
    service of an absent master, whose best clothes and jewellery
    DONALD wore, while he kept his flat well aired by giving little
    supper-parties to young ladies who took him at his own
    valuation,&mdash;for a very superior swell. Alas! he was but a
    <i>valet de sham</i>! "Cross purposes," but Magistrate
    "disposes"; and the once happy Valet is in the shade for the

    <p>It is curious to find a coincidence in style and in idea
    between an earnest, witty and pious English author of the
    Sixteenth Century, and an American author of our own day. Yet
    so it is, and here is the parallel to be found between the
    quaint American tales about the old negro, <i>Uncle Remus</i>,
    by JOEL CHANDLER HARRIS, in this year of Grace, 1892, and the
    fables writ by Sir THOMAS MORE in 1520, or thereabouts, which
    he represents as if told him by an old wife and nurse, one
    Mother MAUD. Here are "The Wolf,"&mdash;"Brer Wolf"&mdash;and
    the simple-minded Jackass, both are going to confession to
    Father Fox&mdash;"Brer Fox." Æsop is, of course, the common
    origin of all such tales. The extracts which I have come
    across, are to be found in a small book compiled by the Rev.
    THOMAS BRIDGETT, entitled, <i>The Wit and Wisdom of Sir Thomas
    More</i>. The Baron wishes that with it had been issued a
    glossary of old English words and expressions, as, to an
    ordinary modern reader, much of Sir THOMAS MORE's writing is
    well-nigh unintelligible; nay, in some instances, the Baron can
    only approximately arrive at the meaning, as though it were a
    writ in a foreign language with which his acquaintance was of
    no great profundity. Certes, the learned and reverend compiler
    hath a keen relish for this quaintness, but not so will fifteen
    out of his twenty readers, who, pardie! shall regret the
    absence of a key without which some of the treasure must, to
    them at least, remain inaccessible. With this reservation, but
    with no sort of equivocation, doth the Baron heartily recommend
    The Reverend BRIDGETT's compilation of Sir THOMAS MORE's
    "English as she is writ" in the Sixteenth Century, to all
    lovers of good books in this "so-called (O, immortal phrase!)
    Nineteenth Century." The Rev. THOMAS hath well and ably done
    his work, and therefore doth the Baron advise his readers to go
    to their booksellers, and, being there, to imitate the example
    of DICKENS's oft-quoted <i>Oliver</i>, and "ask for MORE."</p>

    <p>Quoth the Baron, "Much liketh me the Macmillanite series of
    <i>English Men of Action</i>, and in a very special manner do I
    laud the latest that, to my knowledge, hath appeared 'yclept
    <i>Montrose</i>, by Master MOWBRAY MORRIS&mdash;a good many
    'M's' in these names&mdash;who hath executed his
    <i>Montrose</i> with as loving a heart and as tender a touch as
    ever did use old IZAAK towards the gentle that he, and the
    simple fish, did love so well. Did not the very hangman burst
    into tears as he thrust the unfortunate nobleman off the step?
    and did not a universal sob of pity break from the vast crowd
    assembled to see the last of the noble cavalier, victim to an
    unfortunate tradition of loyalty? What wonder then if we
    sympathise with this luckless hero of romance? The weak-knee'd
    villain of this historical drama was '<i>Charles</i> (his
    friend),' in which character, be it allowed, this sad dog of a
    Merry Monarch not infrequently appeared. Thank you much, Mr.
    MOWBRAY MONTROSE MORRIS," quoth</p>

    (<i>Laughter.</i>)" Mr. WOODALL: "Without being wrecked in the
    attempt. (<i>Renewed laughter.</i>)" Oh, witty WOODALL! Why,
    encouraged by this applause, he may yet be led on to make a pun
    on his own name, and say, "<i>Would all</i> were like him!" or
    some such merry jest. The proceedings in this Committee were
    becoming a trifle dull, but it is to be hoped that they may yet
    hear something still more sparkling from the wise and witty
    WOODALL.</p>

    <h2>TAKING A SIGHT AT RINGANDKNOCK.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>By Ruddier Stripling.</i>)</h4>

    <p>After the roughness of the Atlantic, in which to my taste
    there is far too much water moving about, I stepped on to
    America with considerable relief. I was quite satisfied, after
    that excellent dinner, the first I had enjoyed since Liverpool
    slid away eastward, to walk aimlessly through the streets till
    I fell into the arms of a broad-shouldered, pug-nosed, Irish
    New York policeman. I remember no more till New York passed
    away on a sunny afternoon, and then I fell asleep again and
    slept till the brakeman, conductor, Pullman-car conductor,
    negro porter and newsboy somehow managed to pull me out into
    the midnight temperature of 80 below freezing. It was just like
    having one's head put under the pump, but it did not quite
    revive me, for I mistook my host in his sleigh for a walrus,
    and tried to harpoon him with my umbrella. After matters had
    been explained, we went off, at least I did, and never woke up
    till I fell out into a snow-drift, just as we turned a corner
    at our journey's end.</p>

             alt="'Ta-ra-ra-Boom!'" /></a>"Ta-ra-ra-Boom!"
    </div>

    <p>In the morning, I had some idea that the sky was a great
    sapphire, and that I was inside it, and that the fields were
    some sort of velvet or wool-work, going round and round with
    the sun rioting over them, whatever that may mean, till my head
    ached. I can't quite understand all this now, but it seemed a
    very picturesque, impressionist description when I wrote it.
    Then I went for a walk down Main Street. I think it is about
    400 miles long, for I got nowhere near the end, but this was
    perhaps owing to my uncertainty as to which side was the
    pleasanter to walk on. At last I gave it up, and sat down on
    the side-walk. Now, the wisdom of Vermont, not being at all
    times equal to grasping all the problems of everybody else's
    life with delicacy, sometimes makes pathetic mistakes, and it
    did so in my ease. I explained to the policeman that I had been
    sitting up half the night on a wild horse in New Zealand, and
    had only just come over for the day, but it was all in
    vain.</p>

    <p>The cell at Vermont was horribly uncomfortable. I dreamt
    that I was trying to boil snow in a thimble, to make maple
    syrup, and to swim on my head in deep water, with a life-belt
    tied to my ankles. There was another man there, and in the
    early morning he told me about Mastodons and Plesiosauri in a
    wood near the town, and how he caught them by the tails and
    photographed them; and also that Ringandknock, a mountain near,
    was mentioned by EMERSON in a verse, which I remembered,
    because he made "co-eval" rhyme with "extended." Only a truly
    great Philosopher could have done that.</p>

    <p>It was all new and delightful; and it must have been true,
    because my informant was a quiet, slow-spoken man of the West,
    who refrained from laughing at me. I have met very few people
    who could do that. Next day all the idleness and trifling were
    at an end, and my friends conveyed me back to New York.</p>

    <h2>THE CONFESSIONS OF A DUFFER.</h2>

    <h3>No. VIII.&mdash;THE DUFFER AS A HOST.</h3>

    <p>Of course I don't try to give dinners at home. The
    difficulties and anxieties are too enormous. First there is
    inviting the people. I like to have none but very clever men
    and very pretty women, but nobody's acquaintance is limited to
    those rare beings, and, if I did invite them, they would all
    have previous engagements: I do not blame them. But suppose
    that two or three of the wits and beauties accept, that is
    worse than ever, because the rest are a Q.C. (who talks about
    his cases) and his wife, who talks about her children. An old
    school-fellow, who has no conversation that does not begin, "I
    say, do you remember old JACK WILLIAMS." This does not
    entertain the beauty, who sits next him.</p>

    <p>A Dowager Duchess, she knows none of the other people and
    wonders audibly (to me) who they are. A clever young man, whose
    language is the language of the future, and whose humour is of
    a date to which I humbly hope my own days may not be prolonged.
    A Psychical Researcher, with a note-book; he gets at the
    Duchess at once, and cross-examines her about a visionary Piper
    who plays audible pibrochs through Castle Blawearie, her
    ancestral home. Does she think the pibroch could be taken down
    in a phonograph. Could the Piper be snapped in a kodak? The
    Duchess does not know what a phonograph is; never heard of a
    kodak. She does not like the note-book any more than <i>Mr.
    Pickwick's</i> cabman liked it. She is afraid of getting into
    print. Then there is the Warden of St. Jude's, a great scholar;
    he pricks up his ears, not the keenest, at the word kodak, and
    begins to talk about a newly-discovered <i>Codex</i> of
    PODONIAN the Elder. Nobody knows what a <i>Codex</i> is. There
    is a School-board Lady, but, alas, she is next the Warden of
    St. Jude's, not next the enthusiastic Clergyman, who proses
    about a Club for Milliners. There is GRIGSBY, who develops an
    undesirable interest in the Milliners' Club. Have they a
    Strangers' Room? Do they give suppers? Are they Friendly Girls?
    Everyone thinks GRIGSBY flippant and coarse; I wish I had not
    asked him to come. There is a Positivist, who sneers at the
    Clergyman; there are a Squire and his wife from Rutlandshire:
    she is next the Radical Candidate for the Isle of Dogs. They do
    not seem to get on well together. GRIGSBY and the humorist of
    the future are chaffing each other across the table: nobody
    understands them; I don't know whether they are quarrelling or
    not. Miss JONES, the authoress of <i>Melancholy Moods</i> (in a
    Greek dress, with a <i>pince-nez</i>: a woman should not
    combine these attributes) is next the Squire: he has never
    heard of any of her friends the Minor Poets: she takes no
    interest in Hay, nor in Tithes. I see the Guardsman and the
    Beauty looking at each other across the flowers and things: the
    language of their eyes is not difficult, nor pleasant, to read.
    Why is the champagne so hot, and why are the ices so salt and
    hard? I know something is the matter with the claret: something
    is always the matter with the claret. It has been iced, and the
    champagne has been standing for days in an equable temperature
    of 65°.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:65%;">
        <a href="images/202.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/202.png"
             alt="'It is midnight; I am tired to death.'" /></a>"It
             is midnight; I am tired to death. Yes, Bielby
             <i>will</i> have something to drink, and another
             cigar&mdash;a very large one."
    </div>

    <p>When they want to go away, it is a wet night, and those who
    have come in cabs cannot get cabs to go back in. The Duchess's
    coachman lost his way, coming here, she was half-an-hour late:
    she is anxious about his finding his way home. GRIGSBY has got
    at the Psychical-Researcher, and I hear him telling stories, as
    personal experiences, which I know are not true.
    Psychical-Researchers have no sense of humour. "S.P.R.," why
    not "S.P.Q.R.?" I hear GRIGSBY asking, and suggesting "Society
    for Propagating Rubbish." It is very rude of him, and not at
    all funny.</p>

    <p>However, they do go away at last, that advantage a dinner at
    home has over a dinner at the Club, there they often seem as if
    they would never go away at all.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, the wine is all right at the Club, I
    believe, for I know nothing about wine myself. Some men talk of
    nothing else, and seem to know the vintages without looking at
    the names on the bottles.</p>

    <p>The worst of giving a dinner at the Club is, that I never
    know how many men I have asked, nor even who they are. It is
    enough if I remember the date. It might be a good thing to
    write these matters down in a Diary, or on a big sheet of
    paper, pinned up in one's room. I know I have written to ask
    some Americans whom I have not seen: they brought letters of
    introduction. I forget their names&mdash;there is a Professor
    who has written a novel, there is a General, I think, and a Mad
    Doctor.</p>

    <p>My best plan will be to stand about in the drawing-room, and
    try to select them as they come in. Here is WILKINSON, who was
    at St. Jude's with me: I shake hands with him warmly. He looks
    blank. It is not WILKINSON, after all; it is a stranger, he is
    dining with somebody else. Some other men have come in while I
    am apologising. One of them comes up and says, "Mr. McDUFFER!"
    He must be an American. Which? He tells me: he is the Mad
    Doctor. He introduces his countrymen; they all say "Mr.
    McDUFFER!" How am I to remember which is the General and which
    is the Professor? Other people drop in. Here is CRIMPTON. He is
    a Reviewer. Clever fellow, CRIMPTON. Here is old
    BEILBY&mdash;he is hot from the University Match. He begins to
    tell me all about it. JONES was awfully well set, but that muff
    SMITH ran him out. BEILBY does not believe it <i>was</i> out.
    Odd the spite umpires always have at our side. Feel that I must
    tear myself from BEILBY, the only man whose conversation really
    interests me. Here is an English writer on military subjects. I
    introduce him to the American General. Find he is the
    Professor, after all. We get down-stairs somehow. BEILBY is
    opposite me. CRIMPTON is next the Professor. The Military
    Writer is next the General. Things do not appear to go very
    smoothly. It seems that the Military one has said something
    about General BEAUREGARD which he should not have said. The
    General is getting red. I hate it, when men begin to talk about
    the American War. Any other war they are welcome to: the Danish
    War, the war of 1866, the war of 1870, the glorious affair of
    Majuba. But Americans are touchy about their war, not easy to
    please them whatever you say. Much best to say nothing.
    CRIMPTON is laughing at American novels. He does not know that
    the Professor is an American novelist. What am I to do? I try
    to kick him under the table. I kick the Mad Doctor, and
    apologise. Was feeling about for a footstool. BEILBY is trying
    to talk about Base Ball to the General, who is still red.
    Nothing is more disagreeable than these international
    discussions at dinner.</p>

    <p>Now, a clever host would know how to get out of this; he
    would start some other subject. I can think of no other
    subject. Happy thought: gradually glide into American cookery,
    clams, canvas-backed ducks, what is that dish with a queer
    name&mdash;Jumbo? I don't feel as if it were Jumbo. Squambo?
    Terapin soup? It sounds rather like the Hebrew for a talisman,
    or an angel of some sort. However, they are talking about
    cookery now, and wines. Is there not an American wine called
    Catawampus? The Mad Doctor has his eye on me; he seems
    interested. I thought I heard him murmur Aspasia, or Aphasia,
    or something like that. It is not Catawampus&mdash;it is
    Catawba. I feel that I <i>patauge</i>&mdash;flounder, I mean. I
    am getting quite nervous; feel like a man in a powder-magazine,
    with lighted cigarettes everywhere. If one can withdraw them to
    the smoking-room, they will settle down somehow. They do. The
    Military Critic gets into a corner with BEILBY. The Americans
    and I consort together. Most agreeable fellows; have been
    everywhere, and seen everything. CRIMPTON, luckily, is reading
    one of his own reviews in the evening paper. I glance at it; it
    is a review of the Professor's novel. Not a kind
    review&mdash;rather insulting than otherwise. He hates BEILBY,
    and he does not know the Military Critic. If he joins us, there
    will be more international discussion. I get them on to the
    balcony, and pretend to go to ring the bell for coffee. I
    whisper to CRIMPTON. He is quite taken aback. "Awfully sorry;
    never dreamed the Professor was not English." He wants to tell
    the Professor that, thinks he will be pleased. He apologises to
    me; it is dreadfully disagreeable to be apologised to by a
    guest. "All my fault," I say; and, really, so it is. CRIMPTON
    remembers an evening engagement, and goes off <i>à
    l'Anglaise</i>.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page203"

       id="page204"></a>[pg 204]</span>

    <p>The Americans go off; say they have enjoyed themselves. I
    feel inclined to apologise for CRIMPTON. On second thoughts, I
    don't. They do not look like men who write about their
    adventures in their native newspapers. Ladies do that. A weight
    is off my mind. The Military Writer goes home. He asks, "Who
    was that old man who fancied himself so about SHERMAN's March?"
    "That was General HOME, who held a command under SHERMAN." The
    Military Writer whistles; wishes I had told him that before
    dinner. I wish I had, but I got so flurried and confused. It is
    midnight; I am tired to death. Yes, BEILBY <i>will</i> have
    something to drink, and another cigar&mdash;a very large one.
    He begins to talk about the University Match, about all
    University Matches, about old scores, and old catches, from
    MITCHELL's year to the present day.</p>

    <p>It is three o'clock before I get home; the Americans
    <i>may</i> have enjoyed themselves, I have not. I dream about
    the Mad Doctor; perhaps he will put me into his next book on
    <i>Incipient Insanity</i>. Serve me right.</p>

    <h2>THE YOUNG GIRL'S COMPANION.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>By Mrs. Payley.</i>)</h4>

    <h4>I.&mdash;THE YOUNG GIRL'S DIARY.</h4>

    <p>My very dear young girls, those Arts and accomplishments
    which form part of the average education will be taught you by
    your Governess, and in some cases, if your parents think it
    judicious, by a male Professor. I do not propose in these
    papers to deal with such subjects. But there are certain points
    in the life of the young girl, about which the handbooks have
    but little to say, which your teachers do not include in their
    course of tuition. Some of these points are particularly
    intimate and sentimental. It is here that I would wish to act
    as your adviser, and, if I may, as your confidential friend. I
    shall always be glad, while these papers are being published,
    to receive and answer any letters from young girls on questions
    of sentiment and propriety. If we had no sentiment, life would
    not stand thinking about; if we had no propriety, life would
    not stand talking about. Of the two, propriety is, perhaps, for
    the woman the more important, but I shall be glad to answer
    questions on both. And now let me say a few words on the
    subject of the Young Girl's Diary.</p>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:25%;">
        <a href="images/204.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/204.png"
             alt="Young girl." /></a>
    </div>

    <p>You must most certainly keep a Diary.</p>

    <p>When I was a young girl of twenty-eight&mdash;it is not so
    very long ago&mdash;I had my Diary bound in pale blue watered
    silk; it had three locks and a little silver key which I wore
    on a riband round my neck. I never took it off except
    to&mdash;I mean for the purposes of the toilette. There was a
    pocket at the end of the book, which would hold a faded flower
    or any little souvenir. I always wrote it in solitude and by
    night. Secresy has its ritual, and it is infinitely sweet and
    consoling. If you should ever choose to read any passage from
    your Diary to the dearest of your girl-friends, the confidence
    becomes in consequence so much more confidential; for she will
    know that you are reading to her what was never intended for
    any human eye to see, and will enjoy it more. If you have the
    least appreciation of what sentiment really means, if you feel
    that you are misunderstood, or if you suffer from the most
    sacred of all emotions, you will most certainly keep a
    Diary.</p>

    <p>The entries in the Diary need not be of any great length. I
    once had a dear girl-friend who, during the happy season of her
    first love, became in the pages of her Diary almost entirely
    interjectional. I think this was from natural delicacy. I was
    recently stopping at her house, and owing to circumstances over
    which she had no control, I am able to reproduce here the
    entries which she made in the few days which culminated in her
    engagement.</p>

    <p>"<i>September</i> 6.&mdash;Why?"</p>

    <p>You observe that she is puzzled to account for her own
    emotions, and yet hesitates to give the inevitable solution.
    The intense reticence of this entry seems to me peculiarly
    beautiful.</p>

    <p>"<i>September</i> 7.&mdash;I hate MARY BINDLER."</p>

    <p>I can remember the circumstances very well, and I am
    inclined to think that she had some reason to be jealous of
    MARY BINDLER. MARY was not at all a nice girl.</p>

    <p>"<i>September</i> 8.&mdash;Joy, joy, joy!"</p>

    <p>I think I can explain this entry. MARY BINDLER had been
    called away hurriedly. Somebody was dead, or something of that
    sort. My friend's expression of relief seems to me very pretty
    and natural.</p>

    <p>"<i>September</i> 9.&mdash;Ah!"</p>

    <p>"<i>September</i> 10.&mdash;Oh!"</p>

    <p>In that little word "Ah!" there is the whole history of a
    pic-nic and a carriage accident. It was there that she first
    guessed his feelings towards her. I am sorry to say that I have
    not been able to obtain any adequate explanation of the "Oh!"
    But I know they went out after dinner to see if it was possible
    to play tennis by moonlight. I conclude that it was not, for
    the next entry, which consists simply of a note of exclamation,
    is really a record of her engagement.</p>

    <p>Of course I need not point out the impropriety of mixing in
    the pages of your Diary the record of the most sacred emotions,
    and notes of things more commonplace. I knew a girl who
    invariably did this. She always commenced with an account of
    any money that she might have spent during the day. I have
    managed, with considerable difficulty, to make a copy of one of
    these entries, and I give it as a warning:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Chocolate, one-and-six. ALGERNON has written to me, asking
    me to see him again for the last time. I have written back that
    my decision is unalterable. It breaks my heart to have to be so
    cruel&mdash;but fate wills it, and it's no good fighting
    against Mamma. Sent my grey to be cleaned&mdash;but it won't
    look anything when it's done."</p>

    <p>In another entry I found the following:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"A dear long letter from EGBERT. How perfect his sympathy
    is! Not feeling very well to-day&mdash;will always refuse
    <i>vol-au-vent</i> in future."</p>

    <p>I need hardly say that a girl who would chronicle the state
    of her digestion and the sympathy of her lover in one paragraph
    could not possibly have any soul.</p>

    <p>The perfect Diary is something of a paradox. It should be
    composed chiefly of what is unpublishable&mdash;of one's
    secrets and sentiments&mdash;but it should always be written as
    if with a view to publication. In your Diary you can say things
    about yourself which it would be conceited to say openly, and
    you can say things about your friends which it would be unkind
    to say openly; you can make your own pose seem more real to
    yourself. So, my dear young girls, take my advice, and commence
    Diaries. And remember I shall be very glad to answer any
    questions on the subject.</p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you

rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://gutenberg.net/license">http://gutenberg.net/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
